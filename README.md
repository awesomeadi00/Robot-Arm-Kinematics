# Robot-Arm-Kinematics
This program simulates the motion of a Robot Arm in multi-degree freedom motion and calculates the end effector at a particular orientation and position. It incorporates 2D Kinematics of a robot and displays the orientation of the robot arm in different inputs of degrees.

# User Guide:
The Robot has already been initialized as "R".  
When inputting angles, they are expressed in radians, hence please type the following: 
- "0" = 0
- "pi" = π
- "pi/2" = π/2
- "3pi/2" = 3π/2
- "2pi" = 2π
- Or whichever other value you wish (expressed in radians).
